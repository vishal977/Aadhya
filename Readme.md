# Aadhya - Women Safety App (Be Her Change)

This repository contains code of an IoT based mobile application built for women safety.

## Main Concern? - Problem Statement

In recent times, there is an alarming increase in the number of rape and harassment cases against women in public transport. Nearly four of five women (79%) in India have experienced some form of harassment  or violence in public and a third groped or touched in public (39%), according to a ActionAid UK report released on Friday on occasion of the International Safe Cities for Women Day. Our project focuses on producing a fool proof safety mechanism for the safety of women in public transport.

## What does it contain?

BeHerChange has 3 modules 

    * Hardware Module (IoT) - NodeMCU
    * Prediction Module
    * Navigation Module
    
## Idea

The cab/auto is attached with a device which has a GPS and GSM module(to trace live location and send data to cloud) in it, 
    
A QR will be pasted in the cab/auto, the passenger has to scan it and can verify the driverâ€™s photo with driver behind the wheels,
    
In the given app the user can add his/her close friends and relatives in case of emergency these contact details will be used to alert them, 
    
There is a panic button in the cab and in your phone, if u press that button twice an alert call/message will go to corresponding friends, relatives and nearby police station. The device attached in the vehicle will have an inbuilt speaker in it, which will make an alarming noise.
    
In the event of a distress call, the police can seize the ignition system of the vehicle, arresting its movement.
